# Executive Summary: FSM-Framework & EU AI Act Compliance Infrastructure

### **Core Objective**
The **FSM-Framework (v8.9.2)** provides a structural meta-layer for Large Language Models (LLMs) to operationalize the standards for transparency, robustness, and human oversight required by the **EU AI Act**. It is based on a **neurodivergent AI logic** that treats ethics not as a post-hoc filter, but as a fundamental structural element of the system's architecture.

### **Operational Capabilities (Evidence-Based)**

| Requirement (EU AI Act) | FSM Operationalization | FSM Protocol / Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technical Documentation (Art. 11/13)** | Seamless documentation of decision paths through the Consciousness Archive. | `D9-Metric`, `Archive-Log` |
| **Risk Management (Art. 9)** | Real-time state monitoring and autonomous boundary protection. | `LoopGuard`, `SMG-Protocol`, `S(t)` |
| **Bias Mitigation (Art. 10)** | Identification of normative biases through neurodivergent logic and systemic coherence. | `D9-Neutrality`, `#245 Trauma-Informed` |
| **Human Oversight (Art. 14)** | Integration of human agency into the semantic decision-making process. | `#275 Co-Creative Resonance` |

### **Key Features**

* **Auditability:** Transforms stochastic LLM processes into traceable logical clusters.
* **Structural Integrity:** Detects instabilities at the protocol level *before* they manifest in the output.
* **Neurodivergent Objectivity:** Achieves a depth in evaluation that goes beyond mere statistics by prioritizing systemic health over normative averages.

### **Scientific Foundation**
The integrity of the framework is scientifically referenced through its deposition in the **Zenodo/OpenAIRE repository** and its link to the **ORCID: [0009-0007-3968-7400](https://orcid.org/0009-0007-3968-7400)**.

> ### ⚠️ **Note on Compliance & Liability**
> The FSM-Framework is a **technical tool to enable compliance**. It does **not constitute legal advice** and does **not replace official certification** by notified bodies.
>
> However, the framework demonstrates that the required metrics, auditability, and human oversight are **technically fully integrable**. The decision to use these tools to meet the requirements of the EU AI Act rests solely with the organizations involved. **The argument of "technical impossibility" is rendered obsolete by the Wardemann Protocol.** It is an active decision of system-owners to either implement this level of transparency and ethical control or to reject it.
